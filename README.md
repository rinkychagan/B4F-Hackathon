<h1>Recycled Art E-commerce Website</h1>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This group project was developed by 4 members including me during a 24-hour hackathon for Bytes4Future! :) </br> Our team created an e-commerce website for Fabio, an artist who specializes in recycled art pieces. Fabio faced challenges in selling his artwork, so we built a platform to help him reach a wider audience and sell his unique creations online.</p>
